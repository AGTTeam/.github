# Welcome to the Anime Game Translation Team's GitHub Organization!

As the name implies, we are a fan-translation team who primarily focus on anime games.

Once we have published a translation patch for a game, we also release the tools and assets:
* [GameName]Translation – Contains the hacking tool for the game, used to extract/repack images and text.
* [GameName]Data – Contains all the text and assets for the English patch.

You are welcome to use these resources for learning, or to create your own translation patches under the MIT License.

For more information on what we're doing, check out our [website](https://agtteam.net/). If you have questions, suggestions, or bug reports, feel free to swing by our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm).
